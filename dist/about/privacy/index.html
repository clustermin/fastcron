                privacy
                policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
                United
                States
                (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
                from
                California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
                information
                being
                collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p> <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p> <p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p> <p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of
