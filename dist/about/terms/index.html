Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) govern your use of our website located at
<b>fastcron.com</b>
(together or individually “Service”) operated by <b>FastCron</b>.</p> <p>Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and
                disclose information that results from your use of our web pages.</p> <p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (“Agreements”). You acknowledge
                that
                you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.</p> <p>If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but
                please
                let us know by emailing at <b>support@fastcron.com</b> so we can try to find a solution. These
                Terms
                apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.</p> <p>2. <b>Communications</b></p> <p>By using our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and
                other
                information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications
                from
                us by following the unsubscribe link or by emailing at support@fastcron.com.</p> <p>3. <b>Purchases</b></p> <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service (“Purchase”), you may
                be
                asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including but not limited to, your
                credit
                or debit card number, the expiration date of your card, your billing address, and your shipping
                information.</p> <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any card(s) or other payment
                method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true,
                correct and complete.</p> <p>We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the
                completion
                of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to
                these
                third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited
                to:
                product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error
                in
                your order or other reasons.</p> <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal
                transaction is
                suspected.</p> <p>4. <b>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</b></p> <p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through
                Service
                may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any
                Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a
                Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.</p> <p>5. <b>Subscriptions</b></p> <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in
                advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles will be set depending on
                the
                type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p> <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same
                conditions unless you cancel it or FastCron cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal
                either through your online account management page or by contacting support@fastcron.com customer
                support team.</p> <p>A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide
                FastCron with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to full
                name,
                address, state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By
                submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize FastCron to charge all
                Subscription
                fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p> <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, FastCron reserves the right to terminate
                your
                access to the Service with immediate effect.</p> <p>6. <b>Free Trial</b></p> <p>FastCron may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period
                of
                time ("Free Trial").</p> <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.</p> <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by
                FastCron until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled
                your
                Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of
                Subscription you have selected.</p> <p>At any time and without notice, FastCron reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free
                Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p> <p>7. <b>Fee Changes</b></p> <p>FastCron, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the
                Subscriptions.
                Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p> <p>FastCron will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give
                you
                an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p> <p>Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your
                agreement
                to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p> <p>8. <b>Refunds</b></p> <p>We issue refunds for Contracts within <b>30 days</b> of the original purchase of the Contract.</p> <p>9. <b>Content</b></p> <p>Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information,
