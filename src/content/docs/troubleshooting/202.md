title: 202 Accepted
---

The HTTP status code 202 Accepted means the requests are received, but not processed yet.

If you have **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) configured on top of the Load Balancer,
they may flag FastCron requests as automated traffic.
They will respond with **202 Accepted** without actually passing the request through.

You should add a custom rule in AWS WAF to **allow requests** to the cron job endpoint
- when the client IP is in our [IP addresses list](/ip-addresses), or
- when they include a specific `Authorization` header, which you can add to the cron job **HTTP Headers**.

The rule runs before the Bot Control and Challenge rules, ensuring the cron jobs are executed properly without weakening overall site security.
After this change, please confirm that your cron job returns HTTP 200 OK consistently.
