This error message means we couldn't connect to your server after X/1000 seconds (generally 60 seconds).
The cause may be a network glitch, your server is down/unreachable, etc.

FastCron automatically retries this connection error once.

If the problem is persistent, please double check your website and see if it's still online or not.
If it's down, please contact your hosting provider ASAP and ask them to check and fix it for you.

If the problem vanishes, hopefully it's just a network glitch, and it solves itself.
