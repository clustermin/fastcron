title: "500 Internal Server Error"
---

**500 Internal Server Error** means that there's something wrong with your server or your script, maybe high server load, memory usage, script settings problem, script error, etc.

You should check your `error_log`, web server error log, `syslog`, script settings, etc, or contact your hosting provider or plugin's author/support and ask whether they can help.

If the problem is temporary only, you can suppress the error by ignoring HTTP status code.
