By default, FastCron sends cron notification emails when your cronjobs fail and succeed again.
You can also receive them via other channels like Slack, Discord, webhook, etc.

To add a channel to your account, please visit the **Channels** tab.
Currently, FastCron supports these 5 channels:

- [**Slack**](/integrations/slack), [**Discord**](/integrations/discord), and [**Teams**](/integrations/teams): messages to your channel.
- [**Telegram**](/integrations/telegram): direct messages or posts to group/channel.
- [**Pushover.net**](/integrations/pushover): push messages to your devices.
- [**Zenduty**](/integrations/zenduty): incidents automatically created and resolved.
- [**Jira**](/integrations/jira): trigger incoming webhook with JSON payload, so you can process it with your own action.
- [**Webhook**](/integrations/webhook): POST requests with JSON payload.

If you'd like to add a custom integration, please email me at support@fastcron.com and I'll add it as soon as possible.
