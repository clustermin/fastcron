By default, FastCron sends cron notification emails when your cronjobs fail and succeed again.
You can also receive them via other channels like Slack, Discord, webhook, etc.

To add a channel to your account, please visit the [Channels](https://app.fastcron.com/account/channel) tab.
Currently, FastCron supports these 5 channels:

- [**Slack**](/integrations/slack), [**Teams**](/integrations/teams), and [**Discord**](/integrations/discord): messages to your channel
- [**Zenduty**](/integrations/zenduty): incidents automatically created and resolved
- [**Webhook**](/integrations/webhook): POST requests with JSON payload

If you'd like to add a custom integration, please email me at support@fastcron.com and I'll add it soon.
