You can transfer your account to another owner simply by **changing your email** to the new owner's email.

## Switch account owner with an admin

When your team grows, it's better to have a generic email (e.g. `devops@`, `team@`, or `dev@example.com`) as the account owner.
So your team members can access the account, manage cronjobs, and receive important email notifications.
You can then add yourself as the account **Admin**.

To do so, follow the instructions below.

## Change the account owner

When you sell your website or restructure your company, you can transfer your FastCron account to the new owner.

Follow these instructions to change the account owner:
- Ensure that you have **disabled Two-Factor Authentication**, **removed your Google account**, and removed any unrelated cronjobs.
- Visit the **Profile** page, in the section **Change email**, enter the new owner email and your current password.
If they already registered an account at FastCron, ask them to delete their own account, or try [migrating the cronjobs](#migrate-the-cronjobs).
- FastCron will send a confirmation link to the new owner.
- The new owner can click on it and claim your account.
- After that, they can [reset the password](https://app.fastcron.com/reset-password) to change the password.

And that's it.

## Migrate the cronjobs

If you want to keep your account and just move the cronjobs to the new owner, follow these instructions:

- Export all cronjobs at Cronjobs > Exports, click **Export all cronjobs**.
- Download it and send it to the new account owner.
- They can import it to their account at Cronjobs > Exports, click **Import file**.
- Once everything is okay, you can **disable or delete your cronjobs** to prevent duplicate executions.
