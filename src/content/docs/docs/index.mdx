FastCron is a simple online tool to help you schedule and run tasks automatically. It's great for things like checking your website, sending emails, cleaning up database, or backing up data. FastCron makes your life easier by doing these jobs for you on time, every time.

## How it works
FastCron works by letting you set up and manage scheduled tasks, called **cron jobs**, through an easy-to-use online interface. Here's how it works:

<Steps>
1. <a href="https://app.fastcron.com/signup" target="_blank">**Sign up**</a>: Create an account on FastCron and log in to access the dashboard.
2. **Create a cronjob**: Click to create a new cron job. You'll need to specify the URL of the task you want to run.
3. **Select an interval**: Choose how often you want the task to run - daily, weekly, monthly, or even more specific intervals.
4. **Configure options**: Add any extra settings you need, like setting a specific time zone or adding custom headers.
5. **Save and run**: Save your cron job, and FastCron will start running it according to your schedule.
</Steps>

FastCron will then automatically execute the tasks at the times you specified, ensuring your jobs are done on time without any manual intervention.
