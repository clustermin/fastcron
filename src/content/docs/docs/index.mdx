FastCron is a simple [online cronjob service](/) to help you schedule and run tasks automatically. 

It's great for things like checking your website, sending emails, cleaning up database, or backing up data. FastCron makes your life easier by triggering these jobs for you on time, every time.

FastCron also has a free <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastcron/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WordPress plugin</a>.

## How it works
FastCron works by letting you set up and manage scheduled tasks, called **cron jobs**, through an easy-to-use online interface. Here's how it works:

<Steps>
1. <a href="https://app.fastcron.com/signup" target="_blank">**Sign up**</a>: Create an account on FastCron and log in to access the dashboard.
2. **Create a cronjob**: Click to create a new cronjob. You'll need to specify the URL of the task you want to run.
3. **Select an interval**: Choose how often you want the task to run - daily, weekly, monthly, or even more specific intervals.
4. **Configure options**: Add any extra settings you need, like setting a specific time zone or adding custom headers.
5. **Save and run**: Save your cron job, and FastCron will start running it according to your schedule.
</Steps>

FastCron will execute the tasks at the times you specified, ensuring your jobs are done on time without any manual intervention.

## Why choose FastCron?
Most hosting providers have the Cron Jobs feature. However, they're very limited.

By using FastCron, you have access to these features:

- **Cron expression**: FastCron supports both standard cron expressions like `*/5 * * * *` and simple patterns like `5 minutes`. Also, check out the [time filter](/blog/time-filter) to match both the day of the week and the day of the month.
- **Custom timezone** for your cronjobs. FastCron also calculates **daylight saving time** (DST) to ensure that your cronjob executes on time.
- **Cronjob management**: you can disable, enable, run cronjob easily with just one click.
- **Queued executions**: know when your cronjob will execute.
- **Cron logs**: see the full history of cronjob executions, including starting time, total execution time, HTTP status, and output.
- Email/Slack/webhook **notifications** when cronjob fails and succeeds.
- **Team access**: allows your team member to create, run, and manage their own cronjobs.
- **Retry** failed cronjob executions.
- [**Repeat**](/blog/repeat-cronjob) cronjob executions until/when its output matches a word.
- [**Max instances**](/blog/max-instances): prevent overlapping or allow up to 5 overlapping executions.
- [**API access**](/reference): create, run, and delete your cronjob programmatically.
