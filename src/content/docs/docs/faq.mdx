## Cron jobs

### Do you support HTTP and HTTPS?
Yes, FastCron supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocol.
It's recommended to use HTTPS for your cronjob URL, like this:
```
https://example.com/backup.php
```

### Do you support self-signed SSL certificates?
Yes, we don't check your SSL certificates.

### Can I run cronjobs for password-protected websites?
Yes, if your website accepts HTTP Basic Authentication, just add username and password at the section **Send HTTP request**.

You can also add a username and password to your cronjob URL like this:
```
https://username:password@example.com/backup.php
```

We also support adding a token in the HTTP headers.

### Can I send cookies along with my HTTP request?
Yes, just edit your cronjob and add your cookie to the **HTTP headers** like this:
```
Cookie: name=value
```
Add multiple cookies like this:
```
Cookie: yummy_cookie=chocolate; tasty_cookie=strawberry
```

### What HTTP methods are supported?
We support GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, and DELETE.

For POST and PUT, you can add the payload (post data).
The payload can be in query format like this:
```
name=value&name2=value2
```
or in JSON format like this:
```json
{
  "token": "API_TOKEN",
  "id": 123,
}
```

For JSON payload, FastCron automatically adds HTTP header
`Content-Type: application/json`
to the HTTP request, so you don't need to.
