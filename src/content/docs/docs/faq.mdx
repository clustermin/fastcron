### How to transfer my account?
To move all cronjobs to another owner, you have 2 options:

- Update your account email to the new owner. Visit Profile > Change email. Enter the new email address, then Save. It will send a confirmation email to the new email address. Once it's confirmed, your account will belong to the new owner.

- Export all cronjobs (visit Cronjobs > Export > Export all cronjobs), then download it and send it to the new account owner. They can import it to their account by visiting Cronjobs > Import and uploading the exported JSON file.
