We will try to answer most of the frequently asked questions below.

## Account
### I didn't get my activation mail.
Please double-check your inbox, spam/junk/trash/archive/all mailboxes for our email.

You can request another activation mail after 5 minutes.

If you have a Google account with the same email, you can log in and activate your account.

### Can I delete my account?
Yes, you can delete your account at any time at Account, Danger zone.

This is not reversible. FastCron will delete your account and all related data permanently.


### What happens when my account expires?
Premium accounts will be downgraded to the free plan. If you have more cronjobs than the free plan limit, some cronjobs will be disabled.

Free accounts don't expire.

### How to transfer my account?
To move all cronjobs to another owner, you have 2 options:

- Update your account email to the new owner. Visit Profile > Change email. Enter the new email address, then Save. It will send a confirmation email to the new email address. Once it's confirmed, your account will belong to the new owner.

- Export all cronjobs (visit Cronjobs > Export > Export all cronjobs), then download it and send it to the new account owner. They can import it to their account by visiting Cronjobs > Import and uploading the exported JSON file.

If you need any help with transferring your account/cronjobs, submit a request and I'll help.

## Billing and payments
### Is the service free?
Yes, FastCron has a free plan with limited features. Please check the [Pricing](/pricing) for plan comparisons.

Upon registration, you'll get a free trial. When the trial period ends, your account will be downgraded to the free plan automatically. You don't need to do anything.

### Do I need to renew my free plan?
No, you don't need to renew the free plan. Enjoy!

### How to add my company VAT number?
When making a payment via Paddle, select the **Country** and click **Continue**,
then click **Add VAT number** at the **order summary**.

You can also add your company name and VAT number after the payment.
Please visit the **Billing** page, click **View Invoice**, and then add your billing address there.

### Can I change my company VAT number?
No, you can't change the country and company VAT number once it's added.
Please cancel your current subscription first, then renew your account with the new company info.

## Cron jobs
### Do you support HTTP and HTTPS?
Yes, FastCron supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocol.
It's recommended to use HTTPS for your cronjob URL, like this:
```
https://example.com/backup.php
```

### Do you support self-signed SSL certificates?
Yes, we don't check your SSL certificates.

### Can I run cronjobs for password-protected websites?
Yes, if your website accepts HTTP Basic Authentication, just add username and password at the section **Send HTTP request**.

You can also add a username and password to your cronjob URL like this:
```
https://username:password@example.com/backup.php
```

We also support adding a token in the HTTP headers.

### Can I send cookies along with my HTTP request?
Yes, just edit your cronjob and add your cookie to the **HTTP headers** like this:
```
Cookie: name=value
```
Add multiple cookies like this:
```
Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco; tasty_cookie=strawberry
```

### What HTTP methods are supported?
We support GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, and DELETE.

For POST and PUT, you can add the payload (post data).
The payload can be in query format like this:
```
name=value&name2=value2
```
or in JSON format like this:
```json
{
  "token": "API_TOKEN",
  "id": 123,
}
```
For JSON payload, FastCron automatically adds HTTP header
`Content-Type: application/json`
to the HTTP request, so you don't need to.

### Does FastCron follow redirections?
Yes, FastCron follows redirections (301, 302, 307, 308).

This feature helps in these cases:
- You changed the script URL with redirections.
- The cron script needs to split into several steps (e.g. Akeeba backup).
