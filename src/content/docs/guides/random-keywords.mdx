To prevent your web server from caching your script execution results, 
you should add a random string to your cronjob URL using the keyword `__random__`.

For example, you set up a cronjob with the URL to call

```txt "__random__"
https://example.com/cron.php?__random__
```
or
```txt "__random__"
https://example.com/cron.php?name=value&__random__
```

Every time your cronjob is executed, the `__random__` keyword will be replaced with a random string:
```txt "oHJXpSbyDMZDEnBJ"
https://example.com/cron.php?oHJXpSbyDMZDEnBJ
```
or
```txt "oHJXpSbyDMZDEnBJ"
https://example.com/cron.php?name=value&oHJXpSbyDMZDEnBJ
```
There are other keywords:
- `__timestamp__` will be replaced with the current Unix timestamp
- `__timestamp_ms__` will be replaced with the current Unix timestamp in milliseconds
- `__cronjob__` will be replaced with the cronjob ID

You can also add those keywords to your POST data (only available with HTTP method POST or PUT).
