If your website uses Cloudflare service, please make sure that Cloudflare does not block FastCron.

To add FastCron's IP addresses to the Cloudflare whitelist, follow this step-by-step:

## Create a list of FastCron IPs

Log in to Cloudflare, visit **Manage Account** > **Configurations** > **Lists**, and create a new list.

Add [our IP addresses](/ip-address) to your new list.

## Create a firewall rule (WAF)

Visit **Security** > **WAF**, create a new firewall rule

Create a new rule to **bypass** all features from all **IP source addresses**
in the previous **list**.

After deploying the firewall rule, FastCron will no longer be blocked by Cloudflare.
