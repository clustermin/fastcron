title: Whitelist FastCron at Cloudflare
---

If your website uses Cloudflare service, please make sure that Cloudflare does not block FastCron.

To add FastCron's IP addresses to the Cloudflare whitelist, follow this step-by-step:

- Create a list of FastCron IPs in your Cloudflare account

Visit **Manage Account** > **Configurations** > **Lists**, and create a new list.

![Lists](https://fastcron.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/14592357410713)

- Add [all IP addresses](/ip-address) to your new list

![IP address](https://fastcron.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/14592489937945)

- Create a firewall rule (WAF)

Visit **Security** > **WAF**, create a new firewall rule

![Firewall rule](https://fastcron.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/14592492087833)

Create a new rule to **bypass** all features from all **IP source addresses**
in the previous **list**.

![Bypass rule](https://fastcron.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/14592516476185)

After deploying the firewall rule, FastCron will no longer be blocked by Cloudflare.
