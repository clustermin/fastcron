## About WP Cron
**WordPress Cron** (WP Cron, `wp-cron.php`) is the internal task scheduler in the **WordPress** website.
It is used to run WordPress scheduled tasks.
Many WP plugins rely on WP Cron to run their backend functions.

By default WP Cron is triggered by website visits: every time a visitor loads your website, there is a small chance that your WP Cron is triggered, and it'll execute on schedule. 
This may not be good for you:

- The **website speed** will be decreased, as it must execute backend functions.

- It eats up your **server resources** e.g. CPU cycles, memory, etc, as it needs to check the scheduled task list every time it's triggered.

- It's not **stable**, as it depends on website visits. If there are no visits for some time, the backend tasks will not be executed.

- It's not **on time**. If you want some functions to execute at an exact time, you'd better use a reliable cronjob service like FastCron.

To set up cronjobs for WP Cron, follow these instructions:

## Disable WP-Cron
Open your `wp-config.php` file with a file manager (e.g. cPanel file manager)
Go to the bottom of the database settings in `wp-config.php`, usually around line #37.

Add the code below:
```php
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
```
then save the file.

## Set up cronjob at FastCron
- Log in to your FastCron account
- Click Add a cronjob 
- Enter the URL to call
 ```
 https://example.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron=1&__random__
 ```
 (replace `https://example.com/` with your actual WordPress homepage URL)
- Select **When to call**: Every 5 minutes
- Click Save changes.

And you're done!

If you have some plugins that needs to update frequently, just change the time interval to **Every minute**.

You may notice that I add `?__random__` to the cronjob URL. It'll add a **random string** every time your cronjob is executed, preventing your web server from caching the HTTP request.
