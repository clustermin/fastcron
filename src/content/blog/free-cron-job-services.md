Some hosting providers limit the usage of their Cron Jobs.
For example, you can't set cronjobs to run more frequently than every 15 minutes.

In that case, you can try a free, online cronjob service.

What is a **cronjob service** (web cron)?
Basically, they run your cronjobs by visiting your cronjob URL at an interval.
For example, to run **wp-cron.php** every 5 minutes,
just set up a cronjob to [https://example.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron=1](/tutorials/wp-cron)

Here are the best free cronjob services:

## FastCron

With [FastCron](/), you can create up to 5 cronjobs running every 5 minutes.
That's enough for your WordPress blog and some simple PHP websites.

The timeout limit is 30 seconds, and you get to see the last 25 execution results.
You'll receive email notifications when your cronjobs fail and succeed again.

## cron-job.org

[cron-job.org](/cron-job-org-alternative) is the most generous free cronjob service.
You can create unlimited cronjobs and run up to every minute.

The timeout limit is 30 seconds.
You'd better keep your script output short, less than 64 KB,
or they will mark your cronjobs as failed and disable them after 15 executions.

They are running a lot of cronjobs every day, so there are some random delays ('jitter') from 4 to 40 seconds.

## EasyCron

[EasyCron](/easycron-alternative) offers free cronjobs up to 200 executions per day,
with a minimum interval of 20 minutes. It's kinda okay for a low traffic blog.

The timeout limit is only 5 seconds. After that, they will stop waiting for your script to complete.
No email notifications when cronjob fails.

By the way, they require you to log in to your free account once a month.

## Other web cron services

There are some other webcron services.
However, their free plans are not as generous as the 3 above. They are less active over the years.
Try them at your own risk:

- Cronless.com
- Cronjob.de
- Cronjobservice.org
