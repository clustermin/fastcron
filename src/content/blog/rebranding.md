I've renamed SetCronJob to **FastCron**. The new homepage is now https://www.fastcron.com/.

The blog has been moved to https://www.fastcron.com/blog.

The default user agent has been changed to\
`Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; FastCron/1.0; https://www.fastcron.com/)`

Emails will be sent from **support@fastcron.com**, **alert@fastcron.com**, and **thuan@fastcron.com**.

The new API endpoint is now\
`https://app.fastcron.com/api/v1/`.

If you encounter any problem with this change, please let me know.
