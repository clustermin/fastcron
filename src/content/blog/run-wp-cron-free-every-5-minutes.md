All WordPress blogs/websites come with a `wp-cron.php` file.
It's essential for scheduling blog posts and cleaning up old records.
Many plugins also rely on **WP cron** to handle their recurring tasks like backing up, sending emails, etc.

Every time your website receive a visit, it has a chance to activate the wp-cron.php file and process scheduled tasks.
This comes with drawbacks like randomly slow page load or delayed tasks.
To mitigate this, many [disable WP Cron](/tutorials/wp-cron) and use a [free cronjob service](/blog/free-cron-job-services) like FastCron.
