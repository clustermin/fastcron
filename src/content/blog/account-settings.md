You can now change:
- Default timezone, which is also account timezone.
- Auto delete stopped [one-time cronjobs](/guides/one-time-cronjobs)
- Auto add [`__timestamp__`](/guides/random-keywords) to cron job URLs to bypass cache.

**For new users only**: FastCron will now automatically delete stopped cronjobs after 30 days.
You can change it on the account settings page.
